## 🚀 Features  

1. **Image Analysis:**  
   - Upload images of agricultural products (e.g., fruits, vegetables, grains).  
   - Identify product type, quality grade, and plant health.  
   - Confidence scores for the analysis.  

2. **Price Analysis:**  
   - Retrieve current market prices, 30-day averages, and price changes.  
   - Historical price data visualization.  
   - Real-time price updates every 5 minutes.  
   - Price predictions for the next 7 days using trend analysis.  

3. **Data Flow:**  
   - Image Upload → Image Processing → Product Classification  
   - Product Identification → Price Data Retrieval → Market Analysis  
   - Historical Data → Price Prediction → Trend Analysis  

4. **User Interface:**  
   - Two-column layout:  
     - **Left Column:** Image analysis and results  
     - **Right Column:** Price trends and market insights  
   - Real-time updates, interactive charts, and market recommendations.

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- PostgreSQL  

### Installation  

1. **Create a virtual environment:**  
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL database:**  
   - Create a database and update connection details in `database.py`.  
   - Run migrations or initialize the tables manually:  
     - `Products` table: Stores product information  
     - `Analyses` table: Stores image analysis results  
     - `PriceRecord` table: Stores historical price data
